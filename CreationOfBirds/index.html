            This work is a search for a bird. As our bodies get constrained to enclosed spaces in this pandemic, "socially" distanced from other bodies, exposed to screens, and algorithmically manipulated by infinite scroll of images juxtaposed with texts - the birds invite us for a performance in the wild. This invitation of staging a performance also questions our relationships with stories, stories generated through texts, the texts that emerge from our relations with the world. This performance is choreographed when a camera (analogous to an machinic eye), the human body, and the bird overlap their sensory perceptions. In other words, only when a camera becomes birdlike, the bird - humanlike, and a human - cameralike, an entaglement is perceived.<br><br>

            The observer is asked to search for a bird by opening the link (shared above) on their device (equipped with a camera). Once the observer opens the link, the application requests the permission from the observer to access the camera of the device. After gaining the access, the camera acts as an eye of the machine and starts detecting the objects in its view. Sometimes a chair, sometimes a mug, and oftentimes a bottle in its vicinity. However, only when the observer is able to find a bird through the eye of the camera, three particular texts are crawled to generate meanings - meanings from the juxtaposition of the words written by Feminist Scholar Donna Haraway on the non-human, texts from Artist Simon Penny on embodied practices, and texts on sensory perceptions from German Biologist Jakob Johann von Uexküll. <br>
           
             
            <br><br>
            On detection of a bird a text appears on the screen for sometime. This text is generated by a morphing of sentences from the texts from the aforementioned artists and scientists thus questioning the agency of this e-literature. Is it the bird on the terrace, the human body which particpates in this performance while searching for the bird, or a learning algorithm that has been trained on images of birds that existed (or might have become extinct) long before the conception of this work? Through this art work, NOTAAT is thus interested in the type of stories that emerge from the generation of dynamic texts through such a performance.
