Uexküll asks us to rethink how we view the reality
of the world as well as what it means to be an animal.
Uexküll proposes to understand the “life story” of
each animal according to its own perceptions and actions: “We no longer
regard animals as mere objects, but as subjects whose essential activity
consists of perceiving and acting.
The focus is on the subjective
animal and its unique environment, each giving rise to new relationships
that were previously unappreciated.
Where mind,
consciousness, rational thought, and spirit have been affi liated with human
life, the opposite has also been true: the body is that which is instinctual,
sensual, mechanical, finite—and animal.
To place oneself outside oneself is a radically disembodying cognitive act that Westerners are so utterly naturalized to that we don't realize we're doing it. Our view of the world, as neutral and natural and objective as we would like to think it is, is both culturally constructed and always inherently subjective.
Zen commentator Alan Watts once said, "Most people think a body is something you have."
The mind-body dualism is related to, but not identical to, the brain-body dualism (which is similarly problematic).
Some cognitive theory gives the impression that the body exists for the brain, solely as metabolic infrastructure for the brain, however,the opposite is the case.
