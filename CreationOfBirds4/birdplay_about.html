            This work is a search for a bird. <br>
            This work cannot be rendered till the cybernetic loop between machinic sense, screen, your mind and body, a bird in the sky, the many birds that have come before that have trained the machine-learning model and your network connection closes. 
            When this loop closes, a text of a few charecters is generated. <br>
            We see this as a performace.<br>
            The time of the day, weather, the population of birds, the location of the machine/human, the 4 texts we have selected, the autors of these texts, their lives and the non humans that they have encountered, all these together make a story of which we imagine ourselves to be a part of. And now by reading this text, you too are inevitably part of this performance. *
           <br> It is to see this text that we make this work in performance with you. 
            The generated text is a to the many poetics and performances that have come before us and have made us who we are.<br> It is to see this text that we make this work. 

            <br>
            if it cannot see, it is not there.
            THis is a work of bodies. 
            I cant social distance from my phone
            if you see the bird in the screen
            the device has an eye now
            it is seeing and it can tell that it is a bird. 
            a projected consience
